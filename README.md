# Red2Green

Red2Green is a web-based application that provides a streamlined, user-friendly profit and loss tracking for stock investors.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and work on tasks.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UFRed2Green/Red2Green.git
cd Red2Green
```

### 2. Work on Tasks
From the Jira subtask(s) assigned to you, create a branch directly (this ensures the Jira issue links properly with your GitHub branch). Otherwise you have to manually type keywords into branch names for them to be linked with Jira.

### 3. Make Changes

Once you have made code changes:

Add files to staging:

```bash 
git add .
```


Commit changes frequently with clear commit messages (following best practices):

```bash 
git commit -m "Add feature X"
```


Push your changes to the remote branch:

```bash 
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Tip: If you prefer, most of these steps (adding, committing, and pushing) can be done more easily through the VS Code UI, instead of the command line.

### 4. Create Pull Request
To create the pull request for your changes (for someone to review them) go to the "Pull Requests" tab on github, assign a reviewer, and create it.
Upon review, you can merge the pull request into the main branch.
